# file-map.md

> Every meaningful file/folder in the repo, one line each, kept greppable so anyone can find where a thing lives. **Code updates this on every add, rename, or delete.**

## How Code maintains this
- Add a line the moment a file is created; update it on rename; remove it on delete.
- One line per file: `path — what it's for` (plain language).
- Group by folder. Keep paths exact so they can be searched.
- If this map and the real repo ever disagree, the map is wrong — fix it (and note the slip in the next completion report).

- `README.md` — short public-facing description + build/run pointer
- `.gitignore` — Swift/Xcode ignore rules (build products, DerivedData, user state, .DS_Store)
- *(missing at kickoff: `ECHO-Notion-Checklist.md` — not present in the repo; flagged in the Phase 1.01 report)*

## Xcode project (`ECHO.xcodeproj/`)
- `ECHO.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` — the project definition (targets, build settings, synchronized groups)
- `ECHO.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/contents.xcworkspacedata` — implicit workspace pointer
- `ECHO.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/IDEWorkspaceChecks.plist` — workspace check defaults
- `ECHO.xcodeproj/xcshareddata/xcschemes/ECHO.xcscheme` — shared build/run/test scheme (committed)

## App source (`ECHO/`)
- `ECHO/App/ECHOApp.swift` — `@main` SwiftUI App entry point; hosts `ContentView`
- `ECHO/App/ContentView.swift` — root view: full-bleed paper background; **owns the `GameState`** and lays out `BoardView` above a throwaway debug bar (Fold / Clear / `turn · echoes` readout, D-017)
- `ECHO/Models/GameState.swift` — `@MainActor @Observable` board state: dimensions (param, default 7×7), stored `start` cell (default center), player cell, turn counter, current run (`[Direction]`) and echoes (`[Echo]`); `move(_:)` (one tile, clamp off-grid, +1 turn, records the move, then checks collision and restarts on a touch), `playerCollides(previousPlayerCell:newPlayerCell:turn:)` (pure collision predicate — land-on OR cross-paths, D-018), `restartRun()` (death restart / future reset-run: player→start, turn→0, run emptied, echoes kept), `fold()`, `clearEchoes()`, `position(of:)`. Pure, unit-tested (D-013, D-014, D-015, D-018)
- `ECHO/Models/Echo.swift` — `nonisolated` value type for one folded run: stable `id: UUID` + recorded `moves: [Direction]`; `position(start:turn:)` is a pure function of start+moves+turn (exhausted echo stands still). `Identifiable`/`Equatable`/`Sendable` (D-014)
- `ECHO/Models/GridCoordinate.swift` — `nonisolated` value type for a grid cell (`row`, `column`; origin top-left); `Equatable`/`Hashable`/`Sendable`
- `ECHO/Models/Direction.swift` — `nonisolated` enum of the four orthogonal moves; `offset` (row/col delta) + `init?(from:to:)` adjacency rule used by tap input
- `ECHO/Views/BoardView.swift` — the real board: grey lattice with per-cell tap targets + translucent grey echoes (drawn beneath; hit-testing off so taps reach the cell, a UI concern unrelated to game collision) + black rounded-square player on top; takes the `GameState` injected from `ContentView`; swipe (drag) and tap input route through `GameState.move(_:)`; placeholder `.easeInOut` slide doubles as the death snap-back (collision is a model rule, so a death just resets turn/player and the board reacts via Observation)
- `ECHO/Audio/` — reserved: generative percussion, Part 2. **Not git-tracked while empty** (no `.gitkeep`, see D-012); reappears when populated
- `ECHO/Haptics/` — reserved: Core Haptics mapping, Part 2. **Not git-tracked while empty** (no `.gitkeep`, see D-012); reappears when populated
- `ECHO/Resources/Assets.xcassets/Contents.json` — asset catalog root
- `ECHO/Resources/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/Contents.json` — app icon set (no artwork yet)
- `ECHO/Resources/Assets.xcassets/AccentColor.colorset/Contents.json` — accent color (system default)

## Levels (`Levels/`)
- `Levels/.gitkeep` — reserved for room JSON files (added from Phase 1.06; not yet wired into the build)

## Tests (`ECHOTests/`)
- `ECHOTests/ECHOTests.swift` — `@MainActor` XCTest coverage of the move model (four directions, four edge no-ops, turn-counter rule, defaults, tap rule), the fold/replay suite (recording, fold→one echo + rewind, replay fidelity, exhausted-echo standstill, two independent echoes, different-length lockstep, empty-fold no-op, `clearEchoes()` pristine, no-op-not-recorded), **plus the collision/restart suite** (land-on via real play, turn-0 immunity post-fold + post-death/no-loop, fatal partial run discarded, exhausted-echo land-on, one-of-many-echoes single death, no-echoes regression, cross-paths clause at the predicate level). Three prior 1.04 replay/lock tests re-pathed to non-colliding walks now that retracing an echo is fatal (D-018)

## Reserved
- `docs/design-handovers/.gitkeep` — reserved for Design-phase handover docs
